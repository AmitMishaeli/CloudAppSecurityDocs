# Protect connected apps using cloud service provider APIs

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

Defender for Cloud Apps provides end-to-end protection for connected apps using Cloud-to-Cloud integration, [API connectors](enable-instant-visibility-protection-and-governance-actions-for-your-apps.md), and real-time access and session [controls leveraging our Conditional](proxy-intro-aad.md) App Access Controls.

Once an app is connected, Defender for Cloud Apps provides deep visibility into the app's user and device activities, and control over any data shared by the app. Build detection policies with governance to mitigate any risky activities or sensitive-data sharing by the app.

Defender for Cloud Apps also provides related app content for threat protection, SaaS security posture management (SSPM), and app-to-app data in use, depending on the support available for each app. For more information, see [Connect apps to get visibility and control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](enable-instant-visibility-protection-and-governance-actions-for-your-apps.md) and individual articles for each app.
