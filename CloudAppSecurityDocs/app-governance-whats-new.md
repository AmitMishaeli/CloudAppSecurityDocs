## App governance October 2022 release
- **Added insights and remediation for sensitive content**: App governance provides insights and automated remediation capabilities through predefined and custom policies for apps that access content with Microsoft Purview Information Protection labels. Enterprise admins now have visibility into the workloads that these apps access and whether they access sensitive data in these workloads. With predefined and custom policies, admins are alerted about apps that have attempted to access sensitive data. Moreover, app governance can automatically deactivate noncompliant apps.
- **Expanded coverage to include all non-Graph API apps** - App governance has expanded coverage to secure more apps in your tenant. In addition to OAuth apps that use Microsoft Graph API, app governance will now provide visibility and protection for all OAuth apps registered on Azure Active Directory.

-  **New video library**: App governance created a new library of short videos on features in app governance, how to use them, and info on how to learn more. [Check it out here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyhj1WZ29G66k4F_OZeMkQymRGyqHwZVp)
- **Secure Score integration GA**: Microsoft Secure Score integration with the app governance (AppG) add-on to Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (MDA) has reached general availability. AppG customers will now receive recommendations in Secure Score, helping them secure their Microsoft 365 OAuth apps.
   Why is this integration important?
   Secure Score is a representation of an organization's security posture and an entry point to various opportunities to improve that posture. By following Secure Score recommendations, customers improve resilience against known and emerging threats.
   AppG is a security and policy management capability designed for OAuth-enabled apps that access Microsoft 365 data. With deep integration into workloads and threat detection capabilities, AppG is well-suited to significantly reduce large attack surfaces in enterprise app ecosystems. By following AppG-related recommendations and enabling proposed policy settings, enterprises can protect both apps and data from misuse and actual bad actor activity. 
## App governance May 2022 release
- **Predefined policies GA**: App governance released a set of out of the box policies to detect anomalous app behaviors. These policies are activated by default, but you can deactivate them if you choose to. [Learn more here](app-governance-predefined-policies.md)
-  **Teams workload GA**: App governance added insights, policy capabilities, and governance for the Teams workload. You can see data usage, permissions usage, and create policies on Teams permissions and usage.
-  **App governance alerts unified in the M365D alerts and incidents queues**: The app governance alerts queue has been unified with the Microsoft 365 Defender alerts experience and are aggregated into incidents.
