> Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (previously known as Microsoft Cloud App Security) is now part of Microsoft 365 Defender and can be accessed through its portal at: <https://security.microsoft.com>. The Microsoft 365 Defender portal allows you to perform your security tasks in one location. This simplifies workflows, and adds the functionality of the other Microsoft 365 Defender services. Microsoft 365 Defender is the home for monitoring and managing security across your Microsoft identities, data, devices, apps, and infrastructure. For more information about these changes, see [Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps in Microsoft 365 Defender](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-security-center-defender-cloud-apps).
