>
> If users encounter the following message:
>  
> **The connection for this site is not secure.**  
> **missing.cert.microsoft.sharepoint.com.us.cas.ms sent an invalid response**
>
> They should manually replace the URL section `.<region>.cas.ms` with `.mcas.us`.

We've updated the sensitivity slider for impossible travel to configure different sensitivity levels for different user scopes, allowing enhanced control over the fidelity of alerts for user scopes. For example, you can define a higher sensitivity level for administrators than for other users in the org. For more information about this anomaly detection policy, see [Impossible travel](anomaly-detection-policy.md#impossible-travel).

- **Enhanced proxy URL suffix for session controls (gradual rollout)**  
On June 7, 2020, we started gradually rolling out our enhanced proxy session controls to use one unified suffix that doesn't include named regions. For example, users will see `<AppName>.mcas.ms` suffix instead of `<AppName>.<Region>.cas.ms`. If you routinely block domains in your network appliances or gateways, make sure you allowlist all the domains listed under [Access and session controls](network-requirements.md#access-and-session-controls).

- **Performance improvements using proxy caching for Session Controls (gradual rollout)**  
We've made additional performance improvements to our session controls, by improving our content caching mechanisms. The improved service is even more streamlined and provides increased responsiveness when using session controls. Note that session controls don't cache private content, aligning with the appropriate standards to only cache shared (public) content. For more information, see [How session control works](proxy-intro-aad.md#how-session-control-works).

## Cloud App Security release 176

Released May 31, 2020

- **New activity privacy feature**  
We've enhanced your ability to granularly determine which users you want to monitor with the ability to make activities private. This new feature enables you to specify users based on group membership whose activities will be hidden by default. Only authorized admins have the option to choose to view these private activities, with each instance being audited in the governance log. For more information, see [Activity privacy](activity-privacy.md).

- **New integration with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Gallery**  
We've leveraged our native integration with Azure AD to give you the ability to navigate directly from an app in the Cloud App Catalog to its corresponding Azure AD Gallery app, and manage it in the gallery. For more information, see [Manage apps with Azure AD Gallery](tutorial-shadow-it.md#gallery-apps).

- **Enhanced proxy URL suffix for session controls (gradual rollout)**  
Starting June 7, 2020, we are gradually rolling out our enhanced proxy session controls to use one unified suffix that doesn't include named regions. For example, users will see `<AppName>.mcas.ms` suffix instead of `<AppName>.<Region>.cas.ms`. If you routinely blocklist domains in your network appliances or gateways, make sure you allowlist all the domains listed under [Access and session controls](network-requirements.md#access-and-session-controls).

- **Performance improvements for Session Controls (gradual rollout)**  
We've made significant network performance improvements to our proxy service. The improved service is even more streamlined and provides increased responsiveness when using session controls.

- **New risky activity detection: Unusual failed logon**  
We've expanded our current capability to detect risky behavior. The new detection is now available out-of-the-box and automatically enabled to alert you when an unusual failed login attempt is identified. Unusual failed login attempts may be an indication of a potential *password-spray* brute force attack (also known as the *low and slow* method). This detection impacts the overall [investigation priority score](tutorial-ueba.md) of the user.

- **Enhanced table experience**  
We've added the ability to resize table column widths so that you can widen or narrow columns to customize and improve the way you view tables. You also have the option to restore the original layout by selecting the table settings menu and choosing **Default width**.

## Cloud App Security release 175

## Cloud App Security release 170 and 171

Released March 22, 2020

- **New anomaly detection: Unusual region for cloud resource (preview)**  
We've expanded our current capability to detect anomalous behavior for AWS. The new detection is now available out-of-the-box and automatically enabled to alert you when a resource is created in an AWS region where the activity is not normally performed. Attackers often leverage an organization's AWS credits to perform malicious activities such as crypto-mining. Detecting such anomalous behavior can help mitigate an attack.

- **New activity policy templates for Microsoft Teams**  
Cloud App Security now provides the following new activity policy templates enabling you to detect potentially suspicious activities in Microsoft Teams:
  - **Access level change (Teams):** Alerts when a team's access level is changed from private to public.
  - **External user added (Teams):** Alerts when an external user is added to a team.
  - **Mass deletion (Teams):** Alerts when a user deletes a large number of teams.

- **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Identity Protection Integration**  
You can now control the severity of Azure AD Identity Protection alerts that are ingested into Cloud App Security. Additionally, if you haven't already enabled the **Azure AD Risky sign-in** detection, the detection will be automatically enabled to ingest high severity alerts. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory Identity Protection integration](aadip-integration.md).

## Cloud App Security release 169

  - [Impossible travel](anomaly-detection-policy.md#impossible-travel)

- **Enhanced Salesforce log collection**  
Cloud App Security now supports Salesforce's hourly event log. Hourly event logs give you accelerated, near real-time monitoring of user activities. For more information, see [Connect Salesforce](./connect-salesforce.md).

- **Support for AWS security configuration using a master account**  
Cloud App Security now supports using a master account. Connecting your master account allows you to receive security recommendations for all member accounts across all regions. For more information about connecting with a master account, see [How to connect AWS Security configuration to Cloud App Security](./connect-aws.md#how-to-connect-aws-security-configuration-to-cloud-app-security).

- **Session controls support for modern browsers**  
Cloud App Security session controls now includes support for the new Microsoft Edge browser based on Chromium.

- **New OAuth app anomaly detection**  
We've expanded our current capability to detect malicious OAuth app consent. The new detection is now available out-of-the-box and automatically enabled to alert you when a potentially malicious OAuth app is authorized in your environment. This detection leverages Microsoft security research and threat intelligence expertise to identify malicious apps.

- **Log collector updates**  
The Docker-based log collector was enhanced with the following important updates:

  - Container OS version upgrade

  - Java security vulnerabilities patches

  - Syslog service upgrade

  - Stability and performance improvements

    We strongly recommend that you upgrade your environment to this new version. For more information, see [Log collector deployment modes](discovery-docker.md#deployment-modes).

- **Support for ServiceNow New York**  
Cloud App Security now supports the latest version (New York) of ServiceNow. To learn about securing ServiceNow, see [Connect ServiceNow to Microsoft Cloud App Security](./connect-servicenow.md).

- **Enhanced detection logic: Impossible travel**  
We've updated the detection logic for impossible travel to provide enhanced coverage and better accuracy. As part of this update, we also updated the detection logic for [impossible travel from corporate networks](anomaly-detection-policy.md#impossible-travel).

- **New threshold for activity policies**  
We've added a threshold for [activity policies](user-activity-policies.md) to help you manage the volume of alerts. Policies that trigger a large volume of matches for several days are automatically disabled. If you receive a system alert about this, you should try refining policies by adding additional filters or, if you're using policies for reporting purposes, consider saving them as queries instead.
