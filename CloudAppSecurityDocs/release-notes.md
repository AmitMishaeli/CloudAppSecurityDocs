> Threat protection product names from Microsoft are changing. Read more about this and other updates [here](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/?p=91813). We'll be using the new names in future releases.

For more information on what's new with other Microsoft Defender security products, see:

- [What's new in Microsoft 365 Defender](/microsoft-365/security/defender/whats-new)
- [What's new in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/whats-new-in-microsoft-defender-endpoint)

> [!NOTE]
> As of August 28 2022, users who were assigned an Azure AD **Security Reader** role won't be able to manage the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps alerts. This change will be gradually rolled out to all customers over the next several weeks. To continue to manage alerts, the user's role should be updated to an Azure AD **Security Operator**.

## June 2023

> [!NOTE]
> Starting in June 2023, updates for app governance are listed together with other Microsoft Defender for Cloud features. For information about earlier releases, see [What's new in the app governance add-on to Defender for Cloud Apps](app-governance-whats-new.md).

### App governance now available as part of Defender for Cloud Apps license

App governance is now included as part of the [Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps licenses](app-governance-get-started.md#licensing) and no longer requires an add-on license.

In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, go to **Settings > Cloud apps > App governance > Service status** to either enable app governance if available, or sign up for the waitlist. Existing holders of trial licenses for the app governance add-on have until August 31, 2023 to enable the toggle and retain their app governance access.

For more information, see:

- [App governance Defender for Cloud Apps in Microsoft 365 Defender](app-governance-manage-app-governance.md)
- [Get started with app governance](app-governance-get-started.md)

### App governance OAuth convergence

For customers who've enabled app governance, we've consolidated monitoring and policy enforcement capabilities for all OAuth apps in app governance. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, we've merged all capabilities originally under **Cloud apps > OAuth apps under  App governance**, where you can manage all OAuth apps under a single pane of glass.

For more information, see [View your apps](app-governance-visibility-insights-view-apps.md).

### Enhanced hunting experience for OAuth app activities

App governance now makes it easy for you to take hunting with app data to the next level by providing deeper OAuth app insights, helping your SOC identify an appâ€™s activities and the resources it has accessed.

OAuth app insights include:

- Out-of-the-box queries that help to streamline the investigation
- Visibility into the data using the results view
- The ability to include OAuth app data such as resource, app, user, and app activity details in custom detections.

For more information, see [Investigate and remediate risky OAuth apps](investigate-risky-oauth.md). 

### App hygiene update with  Microsoft Entra

Starting June 1, 2023, management of unused apps, unused credentials, and expiring credentials will only be available to app governance customers with Microsoft Entra Workload Identities Premium.

For more information, see [What are workload identities?](/azure/active-directory/workload-identities/workload-identities-overview)

## April 2023

### Defender for Cloud Apps release 251-252

April 30, 2023

- **The Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps integration into Microsoft 365 Defender is Generally Available (GA)**. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps in Microsoft 365 Defender](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-security-center-defender-cloud-apps).

- **The automatic redirection option is Generally Available (GA)**. Admins can use this option to redirect users from the standalone Defender for Cloud Apps portal to Microsoft 365 Defender. 

    By default, this option is set to **Off**. Admins must explicitly opt in by switching the toggle to **On** to exclusively use the Microsoft 365 Defender experience. 
    
    For more information, see [Redirecting accounts from Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps to Microsoft 365 Defender](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-security-mda-redirection).

- **Settings pages updates**:

    The capabilities on the following pages are fully integrated into Microsoft 365 Defender, and therefore don't have their own standalone experience in Microsoft 365 Defender:
  
    - [Settings > Azure AD Identity Protection](/microsoft-365/security/defender/investigate-alerts)
    - [Settings > App Governance](app-governance-get-started.md)
    - [Settings > Microsoft Defender for Identity](/defender-for-identity/deploy-defender-identity)
  
    The following pages are planned for deprecation together with the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps portal:

    - **Settings > Export settings**
    - **Activity log > Web traffic log**

### Defender for Cloud Apps release 250

April 24, 2023

- Zoom App connector for SSPM (Public preview)

    Defender for Cloud apps now supports a new Zoom App connector for SSPM. For more information, see [Connect Zoom to Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](connect-zoom.md).  


April 2, 2023

- New "behaviors" data type in Microsoft 365 Defender advanced hunting (Preview)  
To enhance our threat protection and reduce alert fatigue, we've added a new data layer called "behaviors" to the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps experience in Microsoft 365 Defender advanced hunting. This feature is intended to provide relevant information for investigations by identifying anomalies or other activities that may be related to security scenarios, but don't necessarily indicate malicious activity or a security incident. In this first stage, some of the Microsoft Defender for Cloud App anomaly detections will also be presented as behaviors. In future phases, these detections will only generate behaviors and not alerts. For more information, see [Investigate behaviors with advanced hunting (Preview)](behaviors.md).

## March 2023
### Defender for Cloud Apps release 249

March 19, 2023

- **Automatic redirection from Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal (Preview)**  
A new automatic redirection toggle will allow you to trigger the automatic redirection from Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps to Microsoft 365 Defender. Once the redirection setting is enabled, users accessing the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps portal will be automatically routed to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. The toggle default value is set to **Off**, and admins will need explicitly to opt-in to the automatic redirection and start using the Microsoft 365 Defender exclusively. You still have an option to opt-out from the Microsoft 365 Defender experiences and to use Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps standalone portal. This can be done by switching off the toggle. For more information, see [Redirecting accounts from Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps to Microsoft 365 Defender](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-security-mda-redirection).

### Defender for Cloud Apps release 248

March 5, 2023

- **Faster load time for protected sessions**  
We've made significant improvements to the loading time of web pages protected by session policies. End users that are scoped to session policies, either from a desktop or mobile device, can now enjoy a faster and more seamless browsing experience.
We've witnessed an improvement of between 10% and 40%, depending on the application, the network, and the complexity of the web page.

- **Support for Tokyo ServiceNow version**  
The Defender for Cloud Apps connector for ServiceNow now supports the ServiceNow Tokyo version. With this update, you can protect the latest versions of ServiceNow using Defender for Cloud Apps.
