<!--migrated, remove-->
[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

This article provides instructions for connecting Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps to your existing Dropbox account using the connector APIs. This connection gives you visibility into and control over Dropbox use. For information about how Defender for Cloud Apps protects Dropbox, see [Protect Dropbox](protect-dropbox.md).

Because Dropbox enables access to files from shared links without signing in, Defender for Cloud Apps registers these users as Unauthenticated users. If you see unauthenticated Dropbox users, it may indicate users who aren't from your organization, or they might be recognized users from within your organization who didn't sign in.

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, select **Settings**. Then choose **Cloud Apps**. Under **Connected apps**, select **App Connectors**.
