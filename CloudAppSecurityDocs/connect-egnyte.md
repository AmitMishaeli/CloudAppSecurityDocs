>[!NOTE]
>Microsoft recommends using a short lived access token. Egnyte doesn't currently support short lived tokens. We recommend our customers to refresh the access token every 6 months as a security best practice.
>To refresh the access token, revoke the old token by following [Revoking an oAuth token](https://developers.egnyte.com/docs/read/Public_API_Authentication#Revoking-an-OAuth-Token).
>Once the old token is revoked, reconnect the Egnyte connector by following the process documented above.
