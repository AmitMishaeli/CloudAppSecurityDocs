# How Defender for Cloud Apps helps protect your Slack Enterprise

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

Slack is a cloud service that helps organizations collaborate and communicate in one place. Along with the benefits of effective collaboration in the cloud, your organization's most critical assets may be exposed to threats. Exposed assets include messages, channels, and files with potentially sensitive information, collaboration, and partnership details, and more. Preventing exposure of this data requires continuous monitoring to prevent any malicious actors or security-unaware insiders from exfiltrating sensitive information.

Connecting Slack Enterprise to Defender for Cloud Apps gives you improved insights into your users' activities and provides threat detection for anomalous behavior.

## Main threats

- Compromised accounts and insider threats

- Data leakage

- Insufficient security awareness

- Unmanaged bring your own device (BYOD)

## How Defender for Cloud Apps helps to protect your environment

- [Detect cloud threats, compromised accounts, and malicious insiders](best-practices.md#detect-cloud-threats-compromised-accounts-malicious-insiders-and-ransomware)

- [Use the audit trail of activities for forensic investigations](best-practices.md#use-the-audit-trail-of-activities-for-forensic-investigations)

## Control Slack with policies

| **Type**                           | **Name**                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Built-in  anomaly detection policy | [Activity from   anonymous IP addresses](anomaly-detection-policy.md#activity-from-anonymous-ip-addresses)  <br /> [Activity from   infrequent country](anomaly-detection-policy.md#activity-from-infrequent-country) <br /> [Activity from   suspicious IP addresses](anomaly-detection-policy.md#activity-from-suspicious-ip-addresses)  <br /> [Impossible travel](anomaly-detection-policy.md#impossible-travel)  <br /> [Activity   performed by terminated user](anomaly-detection-policy.md#activity-performed-by-terminated-user) (requires Azure Active Directory as IdP)   <br />[Multiple failed   login attempts](anomaly-detection-policy.md#multiple-failed-login-attempts)  <br /> [Unusual   administrative activities](anomaly-detection-policy.md#unusual-activities-by-user)<br />   [Unusual impersonated activities](anomaly-detection-policy.md#unusual-activities-by-user) |
| Activity  policy                   | Built a customized policy by the  [Slack Audit Log](https://api.slack.com/admins/audit-logs#audit_logs_actions) activities |

For more information about creating policies, see [Create a policy](control-cloud-apps-with-policies.md#create-a-policy).

## Automate governance controls

In addition to monitoring for potential threats, you can apply and automate the following Slack governance actions to remediate detected threats:

| **Type**        | **Action**                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| User governance | Notify user on  alert (via Azure AD)<br />  Require user to sign in again (via Azure AD)   <br /> Suspend user (via Azure AD) |

For more information about remediating threats from apps, see [Governing connected apps](governance-actions.md).

## Protect Slack in real time

Review our best practices for [securing and collaborating with external users](best-practices.md#secure-collaboration-with-external-users-by-enforcing-real-time-session-controls) and [blocking and protecting the download of sensitive data to unmanaged or risky devices](best-practices.md#block-and-protect-download-of-sensitive-data-to-unmanaged-or-risky-devices).
