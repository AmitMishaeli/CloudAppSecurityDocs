# Contact Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps support

This article describes how to access Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps support from the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. The support widget in Microsoft 365 Defender helps you find solutions to common problems or submit a support case to the Microsoft support team.

## Prerequisites

To open support cases, you must have access to Microsoft 365 Defender as a **Service Support Administrator** or a **Helpdesk Administrator**. Any roles that include the action `microsoft.office365.supportTickets/allEntities/allTasks` can submit a case.

For more information, see [Security Administrator permissions](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#security-administrator) and [About admin roles](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

## Find solutions to common problems

Access the Microsoft 365 Defender support widget by selecting the **?** icon at the top of the page. Then, enter text in the search box to find self-help solutions. For example:

For example:

1. Enter a title and description for the issue you are facing, and the phone number and email address where we may reach you.
1. Select whether you consent to record service calls, and confirm your preferred contact method. 
1. (Optional) Include up to five attachments that are relevant to the issue to provide additional context for the support case.

The request is sent to Microsoft Support Team. The team will respond to your service request shortly.
