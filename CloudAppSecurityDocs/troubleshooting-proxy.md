# Troubleshooting access and session controls for admin users

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

This article provides Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps admins with guidance on how to investigate and resolve common access and session control issues as experienced by admins.

## Check minimum requirements

Before you start troubleshooting, make sure your environment meets the following minimum general requirements for access and session controls.

|Requirement  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Licensing**     |   Make sure you have a valid [license](https://aka.ms/M365EnterprisePlans) for Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.      |
|**Single Sign-On (SSO)**     |  Apps must be configured with one of the supported SSO solutions: <br><br>  - Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) using SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect 2.0 <br>- Non-Microsoft IdP using SAML 2.0       |
|**Browser support**     |  Session controls are available for browser-based sessions on the latest versions of the following browsers: <br><br>- Microsoft Edge<br>Google Chrome<br>Mozilla Firefox<br>or Apple Safari      |
|**Downtime**     |   Defender for Cloud Apps allows you to define the default behavior to apply if there's a service disruption, such as a component not functioning correctly. <br><br>For example, you might choose to harden (block) or bypass (allow) users from taking actions on potentially sensitive content when the normal policy controls cannot be enforced. <br><br>To configure the default behavior during system downtime, in Microsoft 365 Defender, go to **Settings** > **Conditional Access App Control** > **Default behavior** > **Allow** or **Block** access.      |

## Network condition issues

Common network condition issues you may encounter include:

- [Network errors when navigating to a browser page](#network-errors-when-navigating-to-a-browser-page)
- [Slow login](#slow-login)
- [Additional considerations](#network-conditions-additional-considerations)

### Network errors when navigating to a browser page

When you're first setting up Defender for Cloud Apps access and session controls for an app, common network errors that may arise include: "This site is not secure" and "There is no internet connection". These messages can indicate a general network configuration error.

**Recommended steps**

1. Configure your firewall to work with Defender for Cloud Apps using the Azure IP addresses and DNS names relevant to your environment.
    1. Add **outbound port 443** for the following IP addresses and DNS names for your [Defender for Cloud Apps data center](network-requirements.md#access-and-session-controls).
    1. Restart your device and your browser session
    1. Verify that the login is working as expected

1. Enable TLS 1.2 in your browser's internet options. For example:

    | Browser | Steps |
    |---|---|
    | **Microsoft Internet Explorer** | 1. Open Internet Explorer<br />2. Select **Tools** > **Internet Options** > **Advance** tab<br />3. Under **Security**, select **TLS 1.2**<br />4. Select **Apply**, and then select **OK**<br />5. Restart your browser and verify that you can access the app |
    | **Microsoft Edge / Edge Chromium** | 1. Open search from the taskbar and search for "Internet Options"<br />2. Select **Internet Options**<br />3. Under **Security**, select **TLS 1.2**<br />4. Select **Apply**, and then select **OK**<br />5. Restart your browser and verify that you can access the app |
    | **Google Chrome** | 1. Open Google Chrome<br />2. At the top-right, click **More** (3 vertical dots) > **Settings**<br />3. At the bottom, click **Advanced**<br />4. Under **System**, click **Open proxy settings**<br />5. On the **Advanced** tab, under **Security**, select **TLS 1.2**<br />6. Click **OK**<br />7. Restart your browser and verify that you're able to access the app |
    | **Mozilla Firefox** | 1. Open Mozilla Firefox<br />2. In the address bar and search for "about:config"<br />3. In the Search box, search for "TLS"<br />4. Double-click the entry for **security.tls.version.min**<br />5. Set the integer value to 3 to force TLS 1.2 as the minimum required version<br />6. Click **Save** (check mark to the right of the value box)<br />7. Restart your browser and verify that you're able to access the app |
    | **Safari** | If you're using Safari version 7 or greater, TLS 1.2 is automatically enabled |

Defender for Cloud Apps uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols 1.2+ to provide best-in-class encryption:

- Native client apps and browsers that don't support TLS 1.2+ aren't accessible when configured with session control.
- SaaS apps that use TLS 1.1 or lower appear in the browser as using TLS 1.2+ when configured with Defender for Cloud Apps.

> [!TIP]
> While session controls are built to work with any browser on any major platform on any operating system, we support the latest versions of Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Apple Safari. You may want to block or allow access specifically to mobile or desktop apps.
>


### Slow sign-ins

Proxy chaining and nonce-handling are some of the common issues that could result in slow sign-in performance.

**Recommended steps**

Configure your environment to remove any factors that might be causing slowness during sign-in, such as firewalls or forward proxy chaining, which connects two or more proxy servers to navigate to the intended page. You may have other external factors affecting the slowness.

1. Identify whether proxy chaining is occurring in your environment.
1. Remove any forward proxies where possible.

Some apps use a nonce hash during authentication to prevent replay attacks. By default, Defender for Cloud Apps assumes that an app uses a nonce. If the app you're working with doesn't use nonce, disable nonce-handling for this app in Defender for Cloud Apps:

1. In Microsoft 365 Defender, select **Settings** > **Cloud Apps**. 
1. Under **Connected apps**, select **Conditional Access App Control apps**.
1. In the list of apps, on the row in which the app you're configuring appears, select the three dots at the end of the row, and then select **Edit** for your app.
1. Click **Nonce-handling** to expand the section and then clear **Enable nonce handling**.
1. Sign out of the app and close out all browser sessions.
1. Restart your browser and sign-in to the app again. Verify that the sign-in is working as expected.

### More considerations for network conditions

While troubleshooting network conditions, also consider the following about the Defender for Cloud Apps proxy:

- **Verify whether your session is being routed to another data center**: Defender for Cloud Apps leverages Azure Data Centers around the world to optimize performance through geolocation. 

    This means that a user's session may be hosted outside of a region, depending on traffic patterns and their location. However, to protect your privacy, no session data is stored in these data centers.

- **Proxy performance**: Deriving a performance baseline depends on many factors outside of the Defender for Cloud Apps proxy, such as:

  - What other proxies or gateways sit in series with this proxy
  - Where the user is coming from
  - Where the targeted resource resides
  - Specific requests on the page

  In general, any proxy will add latency. The advantages of the Defender for Cloud Apps proxy are:

  - Leveraging the global availability of Azure domain controllers to geolocate users to the nearest node and reduce their round-trip distance. Azure domain controllers can do this on a scale that few services around the world have.

  - Leveraging the integration with Azure AD Conditional Access to only route the sessions you want to proxy to our service, instead of all users in all situations.

## Device identification issues

Defender for Cloud Apps provides the following options for identifying a device's management state.

1. Microsoft Intune compliance
1. Hybrid Azure AD Domain joined
1. Client certificates

For more information on device identification, see [Managed Device Identification](proxy-intro-aad.md#managed-device-identification).

Common device identification issues you may encounter include

- [Misidentified Intune Compliant or Hybrid Azure AD joined devices](#misidentified-intune-compliant-or-hybrid-azure-ad-joined-devices)
- [Client certificates are not prompting when expected](#client-certificates-are-not-prompting-when-expected)
- [Client certificates are prompting at every login](#client-certificates-are-prompting-at-every-login)
- [Additional considerations](#device-identification-additional-considerations)

### Misidentified Intune Compliant or Hybrid Azure AD joined devices

Azure AD Conditional Access enables Intune-compliant and Hybrid Azure AD joined device information to be passed directly to Defender for Cloud Apps, where you can use the device state as a filter for access or session policies. For more information, see [Introduction to device management in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/devices/overview).

**Recommended steps**

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, select **Settings**. Then choose **Cloud Apps**.
1. Under **Conditional Access App Control**, select **Device identification**. This page shows the device identification options available in Defender for Cloud Apps.
1. For **Intune compliant device identification** and **Hybrid Azure AD joined identification** respectively, click **View configuration** and verify that the services are set up.

   > [!NOTE]
   > These are automatically synced from Azure AD and Intune respectively.

1. Create an access or session policy with the **Device Tag** filter equal to **Hybrid Azure AD joined**, **Intune compliant**, or both.
1. In a browser, log in to a device that is Hybrid Azure AD joined or Intune compliant based on your policy filter.
1. Verify that activities from these devices are populating the log. In Defender for Cloud Apps, on the **Activity log** page, [filter](activity-filters.md) on **Device Tag** equal to **Hybrid Azure AD joined**, **Intune compliant**, or both based on your policy filters.
1. If activities are not populating in the Defender for Cloud Apps activity log, go to Azure AD and do the following:
    1. Under **Monitoring** > **Sign-ins**, verify that there are sign-in activities in logs.
    1. Select the relevant log entry for the device you logged into.
    1. In the **Details** pane, on the **Device info** tab, verify that the device is **Managed** (Hybrid Azure AD joined) or **Compliant** (Intune compliant). If you can't verify either state, try another log entry or ensure that your device data is configured correctly in Azure AD.
    1. For Conditional Access, some browsers may require additional configuration such as installing an extension. Use the information in the [Conditional Access browser support](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-conditions#supported-browsers) guide to configure your browser.
    1. If you still don't see the device information in the **Sign-ins** page, open a support ticket for Azure AD.

### Client certificates are not prompting when expected

The device identification mechanism can request authentication from relevant devices using client certificates. You can upload an X.509 root or intermediate certificate authority (CA) formatted in the PEM certificate format. These certificates must contain the public key of the CA, which is then used to sign the client certificates presented during a session. For more information about client certificates, see [Client-certificate authenticated devices](proxy-intro-aad.md#client-certificate-authenticated-devices).

**Recommended steps**

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, select **Settings**. Then choose **Cloud Apps**.
1. Under **Conditional Access App Control**, select **Device identification**. This page shows the device identification options available in Defender for Cloud Apps.
1. Verify that you uploaded an X.509 root or intermediate CA. You must upload the CA that is used to sign your relevant certificate authority.
1. Create an access or session policy with the **Device Tag** filter equal to **Valid client certificate**.
1. Make sure that your client certificate is:
    - Deployed using the PKCS #12 file format, typically a .p12 or .pfx file extension
    - Installed in the user store, not the device store, of the device you're using for testing
1. Restart your browser session
1. When logging in to the protected app
    - Verify that you're redirected to the URL `<https://*.managed.access-control.cas.ms/aad_login>`
    - If you're using iOS, make sure you're using the Safari browser
    - If you're using Firefox, you must also add the certificate to Firefox's own certificate store. All other browsers use the same default certificate store. Learn [how to add a certificate to the Firefox certificate store](https://www.jscape.com/blog/firefox-client-certificate).
1. Validate that the client certificate prompted in your browser.
    - If it doesn't appear, try a different browser. Most major browsers support performing a client certificate check. However, mobile and desktop apps often leverage built-in browsers that may not support this check and therefore affect authentication for these apps.
1. Verify that activities from these devices are populating the log. In Defender for Cloud Apps, on the **Activity log** page, [filter](activity-filters.md) on **Device Tag** equal to **Valid client certificate**.
1. If you still don't see the prompt, open a [support ticket](support-and-ts.md) and include the following information:
    - The details of the browser or native app where you experienced the problem
    - The operating system version (ex. iOS/Android/Windows 10)
    - Mention if the prompt is working on Edge Chromium

### Client certificates are prompting at every login

If you're experiencing the client certificate popping up after opening a new tab, this might be due to settings hidden within **Internet Options**.

| Browser | Steps |
|---|---|
| Microsoft Internet Explorer | 1. Open Internet Explorer<br />2. Select **Tools** > **Internet Options** > **Advance** tab<br />3. Under **Security**, select **Don't prompt for Client Certificate selection when only one certificate exists**<br />4. Select **Apply**, and then select **OK**<br />5. Restart your browser and verify that you can access the app without the additional prompts |
| Microsoft Edge / Edge Chromium | 1. Open search from the taskbar and search for "Internet Options"<br />2. Select **Internet Options**<br />3. Select **Security**, select **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom level**<br />4. Under **Miscellaneous** > **Don't prompt for Client Certificate selection when only one certificate exists**, select **Disable**<br />5. Click **OK** to close the custom level dialog box<br />6. Click **Apply**, and then select **OK** to close Internet options<br />7. Restart your browser and verify that you can access the app without the additional prompts |

<a name="device-identification-additional-considerations"></a>

### Additional considerations

While troubleshooting device identification, there are some additional things to consider.

- **Client Certificate Revocation Protocol**

    You can require certificate revocation for Client Certificates. Certificates that have been revoked by the CA no longer be trusted. Selecting this option will require all certificates to pass the CRL protocol. If your client certificate doesn't contain a CRL endpoint, you won't be able to connect from the managed device.

## Issues when onboarding an app

You can onboard the following types of apps for access and session controls:

- Catalog apps: Apps that come with session controls out-of-the-box as indicated by the **Session control** label

- Any (custom) apps: Custom line-of-business (LOB) or on-premises apps can be onboarded to session controls by an admin

![Proxy list showing catalog and any (custom) apps.](media/troubleshooting-onboarding.png)

When onboarding an app, it is crucial to make sure that you follow each step in the proxy deployment guides:

1. [Deploy catalog apps with session controls](proxy-deployment-aad.md)
1. [Deploy custom LOB apps, non-featured SaaS apps, and on-premises apps hosted via the Azure AD app proxy with session controls](proxy-deployment-any-app.md)

Common scenarios you may encounter while onboarding an app include:

- [App does not appear on the **Conditional Access App Control apps** page](#app-does-not-appear-on-the-conditional-access-app-control-apps-page)
- [App status: Continue Setup](#app-status-continue-setup)
- [Cannot configure controls for native apps](#cannot-configure-controls-for-native-apps)
- [**App is not recognized** page appears](#something-went-wrong-page-appears)
- [**Request session control** option appears](#request-session-control-option-appears)
- [Additional considerations](#onboarding-apps-additional-considerations)

### App does not appear on the Conditional Access App Control apps page

When onboarding an app to Conditional Access App Control, the final step in the deployment guides is to have the end user navigate to the app. The recommendations listed below are steps that can be done if the app isn't appearing after having gone through the guides.

**Recommended steps**

1. Make sure your app meets the Conditional Access app prerequisites

| Identity provider | Validations |
|---|---|
| Azure AD | 1. Make sure you have a valid license for Azure AD Premium P1 in addition to a Defender for Cloud Apps license<br />2. Make sure that the app uses the SAML 2.0  or the OpenID Connect protocol<br />3. Make sure that the app SSO in Azure AD |
| Non-Microsoft | 1. Make sure you have a valid Defender for Cloud Apps license<br />2. Create a duplicate app<br />3. Make sure that the app uses the SAML protocol<br />4. Validate that you have fully onboarded the app and the status of the app is **Connected** |

1. In your Azure AD policy, under the **Session**, make sure that the session is forced to route to Defender for Cloud Apps, which will in turn allow the app to appear in on the **Conditional Access App Control apps** page, as follows:
    1. Conditional Access App Control is selected
    1. In the built-in policies drop-down, make sure **Monitor only** is selected
1. Make sure to navigate to the app in a new browser session by using a new incognito mode or by signing in again.

### App status: Continue Setup

An app's status can vary from **Continue Setup**, **Connected**, and **No Activities**.

For apps connected via non-Microsoft identity providers (IdP), if the setup isn't complete, when accessing the app you will see a page with the status of **Continue Setup**. Use the following steps complete the setup.

**Recommended steps**

1. Click **Continue Setup**.
1. Go through the [deployment guide](proxy-deployment-any-app.md) and verify that you have completed all the steps. Pay particular attention to the following:
    1. Make sure you create a new custom SAML app. You need this to change the URLs and SAML attributes that might not be available in gallery apps.
    1. If your identity provider doesn't allow the reuse of the same identifier (also known as Entity ID or Audience), change the identifier of the original app.

### Cannot configure controls for native apps

Native apps can be detected heuristically and you can use access policies to monitor or block them. Use the following steps to configure controls for native apps.

**Recommended steps**

1. In an access policy, add a **Client app** filter, and set it equal to **Mobile and desktop**.
1. Under Actions, select **Block**.
1. Optionally, customize the blocking message that your users get when they're unable to download files, for example, "You must use a web browser to access this app".
1. Test and validate that the control is working as expected.

### App is not recognized page appears

Defender for Cloud Apps can recognize over 31,000 apps through the **Cloud App Catalog**. If you're using a custom app that is configured through Azure AD SSO that is NOT one of the 31,000 apps, you will come across an **App is not recognized** page. To resolve the issue, you must configure the app on the Conditional Access App Control.

**Recommended steps**

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, select **Settings**. Then choose **Cloud Apps**. Under **Connected apps**, select **Conditional Access App Control apps**.
1. In the banner, select **View new apps**.
1. In the list of new apps, locate the app that you are onboarding, click on the **+** sign, and then click **Add**.
    1. Select whether the app is a **custom** or **standard** app.
    1. Continue through the wizard, make sure that specified **User-defined domains** are correct for the app you're configuring.
1. Verify the app appears in the **Conditional Access App Control apps** page.

### Request session control option appears

After adding an app, you may see the **Request session control** option. This occurs because only catalog apps have out-of-the-box session controls. For any other app, you must go through a self-onboarding process.

**Recommended steps**

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, select **Settings**. Then choose **Cloud Apps**.
1. Under **Conditional Access App Control**, select **App onboarding/maintenance**.
1. Enter the user principal name or email for the users that will be onboarding the app, and then select **Save**.
1. Go to the app that you're deploying. The page you see depends on whether the app is recognized. Do one of the following:

    | App status | Description | Steps |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Not recognized | You will see an app not recognized page prompting you to configure your app. | 1. [Add the app to Conditional Access App Control](proxy-deployment-any-app.md).<br /> 2. [Add the domains for the app](proxy-deployment-any-app.md), and then return to the app and refresh the page.<br /> 3. [Install the certificates for the app](proxy-deployment-any-app.md). |
    | Recognized | You will see an onboarding page prompting you to continue the app configuration process. | - [Install the certificates for the app](proxy-deployment-any-app.md). <br /><br /> **Note:** Make sure the app is configured with all domains required for the app to function correctly. To configure additional domains, proceed to [Add the domains for the app](proxy-deployment-any-app.md), and then return to the app page. |

<a name="onboarding-apps-additional-considerations"></a>

### Additional considerations

While troubleshooting onboarding apps, there are some additional things to consider.

- **Apps in Conditional Access App Control don't align with Azure AD apps**

    The app names in Azure AD and Defender for Cloud Apps might differ based on the ways the products identify apps. Defender for Cloud Apps identifies apps using the app's domains and adds them to the [cloud app catalog](risk-score.md#the-cloud-app-catalog), where we have over 31,000 apps. Within each app, there you can view or add to the subset of domains. In contrast, Azure AD identifies apps using service principals. For more information, see [app and service principal objects in Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals).

    In practice, it means that selecting **SharePoint Online** in Azure AD is equivalent to selecting apps, such as Word Online and Teams, in Defender for Cloud Apps because the apps use the `sharepoint.com` domain.

## Issues when creating access and session policies

Defender for Cloud Apps provides the following configurable policies:

1. [Access policies](access-policy-aad.md): To monitor or block access to browser, mobile, and/or desktop apps
1. [Session policies](session-policy-aad.md). To monitor, block, and perform specific actions to prevent data infiltration and exfiltration scenarios in the browser

To use these policies in Defender for Cloud Apps, you must first configure a policy in Azure AD Conditional Access to extend session controls, as follows: In the Azure AD policy, under **Access controls**, click **Session**, select **Use Conditional Access App Control** and choose a built-in policy (**Monitor only** or **Block downloads**) or **Use custom policy** to set an advanced policy in Defender for Cloud Apps, and then click **Select**.

Common scenarios you may encounter while configuring these policies include:

- [In Conditional Access policies, you cannot see the **Conditional Access App Control** option](#in-conditional-access-policies-you-cannot-see-the-conditional-access-app-control-option)
- [Error message when creating a policy: You don't have any apps deployed with Conditional Access App Control](#error-message-when-creating-a-policy-you-dont-have-any-apps-deployed-with-conditional-access-app-control)
- [Cannot create session policies for an app](#cannot-create-session-policies-for-an-app)
- [Cannot choose **Inspection Method**: **Data Classification Service**](#cannot-choose-inspection-method-data-classification-service)
- [Cannot choose **Action**: **Protect**](#cannot-choose-action-protect)
- [Additional considerations](#policies-additional-considerations)

### In Conditional Access policies, you cannot see the Conditional Access App Control option

To route sessions to Defender for Cloud Apps, Azure AD Conditional Access policies must be configured to include Conditional Access App Control session controls.

**Recommended steps**

- If you don't see the **Conditional Access App Control** option in your Conditional Access policy, make sure that you have a valid license for Azure AD Premium P1 as well as a valid Defender for Cloud Apps license.

### Error message when creating a policy: You don't have any apps deployed with Conditional Access App Control

When creating an access or session policy, you may see the following error message: "You don't have any apps deployed with Conditional Access App Control". This error indicates that the app has not been deployed.

**Recommended steps**

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, select **Settings**. Then choose **Cloud Apps**. Under **Connected apps**, select **Conditional Access App Control apps**.

1. If you see the message **No apps connected**, use the following guide to deploy apps:

    - [Deploy catalog apps that have session control enabled](proxy-deployment-aad.md)
    - [Deploy custom line-of-business apps, non-featured SaaS apps, and on-premises apps](proxy-deployment-any-app.md) hosted via the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Application Proxy with session controls
1. If you run into any issues while deploying the app, see [Onboarding an app](#onboarding-an-app).

### Cannot create session policies for an app

After adding a custom app, in the **Conditional Access App Control apps** page, you may see the option: **Request session control**.

> [!NOTE]
> [Catalog apps](proxy-intro-aad.md#session-controls) have out-of-the-box session controls. For any other apps, you must go through a self-onboarding process.

**Recommended steps**

1. Use the following self-onboarding guide to deploy any app to session control: [Deploy custom line-of-business apps, non-featured SaaS apps, and on-premises apps](proxy-deployment-any-app.md) hosted via the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Application Proxy with session controls.
1. Create a session policy, select the **App** filter, make sure that your app is now listed in the dropdown list.

### Cannot choose Inspection Method: Data Classification Service

In session policies, when using the **Control file download (with inspection)** session control type, you can use the **Data Classification Service** inspection method to scan your files in real time and detect sensitive content that matches any of the criteria you have configured. If the **Data Classification Service** inspection method isn't available, use the following steps to investigate the issue.

**Recommended steps**

1. Verify that the **Session control type** is set to **Control file download (with inspection)**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Data Classification Service** inspection method is only available for the **Control file download (with inspection)** option.

1. Determine whether the **Data Classification Service** feature is available in your [region](dcs-inspection.md).
    1. If the feature isn't available in your region, use the **Built-in DLP** inspection method.
    1. If the feature is available in your region but you still can't see the **Data Classification Service** inspection method, open a [support ticket](support-and-ts.md).

### Cannot choose Action: Protect

In session policies, when using the **Control file download (with inspection)** session control type, in addition to the **Monitor** and **Block** actions, you can specify the **Protect** action. This action enables you to permit file downloads with the option to encrypt or apply permissions to the file based on conditions, content inspection, or both. If the **Protect** action isn't available, use the following steps to investigate the issue.

**Recommended steps**

1. If the **Protect** action isn't available or is greyed out, verify that you have the Azure Information Protection (AIP) Premium P1 license. For more information, see [Microsoft Information Protection integration](azip-integration.md).
1. If the **Protect** action is available, but aren't seeing the appropriate labels.
    1. In Defender for Cloud Apps, in the menu bar, click the settings cog, select **Microsoft Information Protection**, and verify that the integration is enabled.
    1. For Office labels, in the AIP portal, make sure **Unified Labeling** is selected.

<a name="policies-additional-considerations"></a>

### Additional considerations

While troubleshooting onboarding apps, there are some additional things to consider.

- **Understanding the difference between the Azure AD Conditional Access policy settings: "Monitor only", "Block downloads", and "Use custom policy"**

    In Azure AD Conditional Access policies, you can configure the following built-in Defender for Cloud Apps controls: **Monitor only** and **Block downloads**. This applies and enforces the Defender for Cloud Apps proxy feature for cloud apps and conditions configured in Azure AD. For more complex policies, select **Use custom policy**, which allows you to configure access and session policies in Defender for Cloud Apps.

- **Understanding the "Mobile and desktop" client app filter option in access policies**

    In Defender for Cloud Apps access policies, unless the **Client app** filter is specifically set to **Mobile and desktop**, the resulting access policy will only apply to browser sessions. The reason for this, is to prevent inadvertently proxying user sessions, which may be a byproduct of using this filter.

## Diagnose and troubleshoot with the Admin View toolbar

The Admin View toolbar provides tools for an admin to diagnose and troubleshoot issues with Conditional Access App Control.

To enable the Admin View toolbar for specific admin users, you first must add admins to the app onboarding/maintenance list.

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, select **Settings**. Then choose **Cloud Apps**.

1. Under **Conditional Access App Control**, select **App onboarding/maintenance**.

1. Enter the user principal name or email address for the admin users that will be onboarding the app.
1. Check the box for **Enable these users to bypass Conditional Access App Control from inside a proxied session**.
1. Select **Save**.

When those users next start a session of an application, the Admin View toolbar will be available.

### Bypass proxy session

If you have difficulty accessing or loading your application, and you'd like to see if the problem is with the Conditional Access proxy, you can use the **Bypass session** button in the Admin View toolbar. It will appear for users who have the [Admin View toolbar](#admin-view-toolbar) enabled.

Once you select **Bypass session**, the application will run without the Conditional Access proxy.

You can confirm the session is bypassed by noting that the URL isn't [suffixed](proxy-intro-aad.md#how-session-control-works).

In the next session of the application, the Conditional Access proxy will be used.

### Record a session

You can help the root cause analysis of problems by providing session recordings to Microsoft support engineers. To record a session, you must enable the [Admin View toolbar](#admin-view-toolbar).

> [!NOTE]
> All personal data is removed from the recordings.

To record a session, follow these steps:

1. 1. From the Admin View toolbar, select **Record session**.
