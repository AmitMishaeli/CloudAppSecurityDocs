# How Defender for Cloud Apps helps protect your Smartsheet

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

As a productivity and collaboration cloud solution, Smartsheet holds sensitive information to your organization. Any abuse of Smartsheet by a malicious actor or any human error may expose your most critical assets and services to potential attacks.

Connecting Smartsheet to Defender for Cloud Apps gives you improved insights into your Smartsheet activities and provides threat detection for anomalous behavior.

## Main threats

- Compromised accounts and insider threats

- Data leakage

- Insufficient security awareness

- Unmanaged bring your own device (BYOD)

## How Defender for Cloud Apps helps to protect your environment

- [Detect cloud threats, compromised accounts, and malicious insiders](best-practices.md#detect-cloud-threats-compromised-accounts-malicious-insiders-and-ransomware)

- [Use the audit trail of activities for forensic investigations](best-practices.md#use-the-audit-trail-of-activities-for-forensic-investigations)

## Control Smartsheet with policies

| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Built-in  anomaly detection policy | [Unusual file share activities](anomaly-detection-policy.md#unusual-activities-by-user)  <br /> [Unusual file deletion activities](anomaly-detection-policy.md#unusual-activities-by-user) <br /> [Unusual   administrative activities](anomaly-detection-policy.md#unusual-activities-by-user)  <br /> [Unusual multiple file download activities](anomaly-detection-policy.md#unusual-activities-by-user)  |

| **Type**        | **Action**                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| User governance | Notify user on  alert (via Microsoft Entra ID)<br />  Require user to sign in again (via Microsoft Entra ID)   <br /> Suspend user (via Microsoft Entra ID) |

For more information about remediating threats from apps, see [Governing connected apps](governance-actions.md).

## Protect Smartsheet in real time

Review our best practices for [securing and collaborating with external users](best-practices.md#secure-collaboration-with-external-users-by-enforcing-real-time-session-controls) and [blocking and protecting the download of sensitive data to unmanaged or risky devices](best-practices.md#block-and-protect-download-of-sensitive-data-to-unmanaged-or-risky-devices).
