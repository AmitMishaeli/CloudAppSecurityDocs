# How Defender for Cloud Apps helps protect your Atlassian environment (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

Atlassian is an online collaborative and software development platform (including Confluence, Jira and Bitbucket). Along with the benefits of effective collaboration in the cloud, your organization's most critical assets may be exposed to threats. Exposed assets include posts, tasks, and files with potentially sensitive information, collaboration, and partnership details, and more. Preventing exposure of this data requires continuous monitoring to prevent any malicious actors or security-unaware insiders from exfiltrating sensitive information.

Connecting Atlassian to Defender for Cloud Apps gives you improved insights into your users' activities and provides threat detection for anomalous behavior. The connector will cover all users in your organization that use the Atlassian platform, and will show activities from Confluence, Jira, and specific Bitbucket activities.

## Main threats

- Compromised accounts and insider threats

- Insufficient security awareness

- Unmanaged bring your own device (BYOD)

- [Detect cloud threats, compromised accounts, and malicious insiders](best-practices.md#detect-cloud-threats-compromised-accounts-malicious-insiders-and-ransomware)

- [Use the audit trail of activities for forensic investigations](best-practices.md#use-the-audit-trail-of-activities-for-forensic-investigations)

## Control Atlassian with policies

| **Type**                           | **Name**                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Built-in  anomaly detection policy | [Activity from   anonymous IP addresses](anomaly-detection-policy.md#activity-from-anonymous-ip-addresses)  <br /> [Activity from   infrequent country](anomaly-detection-policy.md#activity-from-infrequent-country) <br /> [Activity from   suspicious IP addresses](anomaly-detection-policy.md#activity-from-suspicious-ip-addresses)  <br /> [Impossible travel](anomaly-detection-policy.md#impossible-travel)  <br /> [Multiple failed login attempts](anomaly-detection-policy.md#multiple-failed-login-attempts)<br/> [Unusual administrative activities](anomaly-detection-policy.md#unusual-activities-by-user)<br/> [Unusual impersonated activities](anomaly-detection-policy.md#unusual-activities-by-user) |
| Activity  policy                   | Built a customized policy by the Atlassian [activities](https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/track-organization-activities-from-the-audit-log/#Auditlogging-Accessauditlogactivities). |

For more information about creating policies, see [Create a policy](control-cloud-apps-with-policies.md#create-a-policy).

## Automate governance controls

In addition to monitoring for potential threats, you can apply and automate the following Atlassian governance actions to remediate detected threats:

| **Type**        | **Action**                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| User governance | Notify user on  alert (via Azure AD)<br />  Require user to sign in again (via Azure AD)   <br /> Suspend user (via Azure AD) |

For more information about remediating threats from apps, see [Governing connected apps](governance-actions.md).

## Protect Atlassian in real time

Review our best practices for [securing and collaborating with external users](best-practices.md#secure-collaboration-with-external-users-by-enforcing-real-time-session-controls) and [blocking and protecting the download of sensitive data to unmanaged or risky devices](best-practices.md#block-and-protect-download-of-sensitive-data-to-unmanaged-or-risky-devices).
