# Get started with app threat detection and remediation

App governance generates alerts using various mechanisms. Threat detection alerts use built-in, machine-learning-driven detection rules to find malicious app attributes and activities. Policy-based alerts are triggered either by predefined policies or user-defined policies. 

To view the latest incidents associated with these alerts, go to the app governance overview at [https://aka.ms/appgovernance](https://aka.ms/appgovernance).

On this overview page, the **Latest alerts** section lists the most recent alerts. You can use this to quickly see the current app alert activity for your tenant.

To see all of the alerts, select the **Alerts** tab.

## Alerts page

App governance alerts are now listed with all other Microsoft 365 Defender alerts. To find them, filter for "App governance" as the service source.
