# Get started with app threat detection and remediation

App governance collects threat alerts that are generated by built-in, machine-learning-driven app governance detection methods based on malicious app activities and policy-based alerts generated by active app policies that you create.

The first place to view app alerts is the app governance dashboard at [https://aka.ms/appgovernance](https://aka.ms/appgovernance).

On this overview page, the **Latest alerts** section lists the most recent alerts. You can use this to quickly see the current app alert activity for your tenant.

To see all of the alerts, select the **Alerts** tab.

## Alerts page

App governance alerts are now listed with all other Microsoft 365 Defender alerts. To find them, filter for "App governance" as the service source.
