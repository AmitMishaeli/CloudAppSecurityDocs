>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance).*

Investigate alerts about malicious cloud apps and apps that can present risks to your organization in the Microsoft 365 Defender **Alerts** or **Incidents** pages.

The **Alerts** page, by default lists, new alerts generated by app governance based on threat detection rules and your active policies. View the details of a specific alert by selecting the alert. A page will open with additional information about the alert and options for managing the alert.

In the page, you can get additional information from the **Alert story** section: 

- Exact details about why the alert was created under **What happened** 
- Information on how to remediate the alert under **Recommended actions** 
   
To investigate and take action on an app in app governance, select the app entity card under **Related entities** and then select ‘View app details’. 

App policies that you configured for automatic remediation from the **Action** will have a status of **Resolved**.

To manage the app governance alert: 

1. Investigation: Examine the information in the alert and change its status to **Mark in progress**.
2. Resolution: After your investigation and, as needed, the determination of app policy changes or continued app support in your tenant, change its status to **Resolved**.

Based on app alert patterns, you can update the appropriate app policy and change its **Action** setting to perform automatic remediation. This removes your need to investigate and manually resolve future alerts that are generated by the app policy.
