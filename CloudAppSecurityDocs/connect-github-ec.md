## Prerequisites

- Your organization must have a GitHub Enterprise Cloud license.
- The GitHub account used for connecting to Defender for Cloud Apps must have Owner permissions for your organization.
- For SSPM capabilities, the provided account must be the owner of the enterprise account.
- To verify owners of your organization, browse to your organization's page, select **People**, and then filter by *Owner*.

## How to connect GitHub Enterprise Cloud to Defender for Cloud Apps

### Verify your GitHub domains

Verifying your domains is optional. However, we highly recommend that you do verify your domains so that Defender for Cloud Apps can match the domain emails of your GitHub organization's members to their corresponding Microsoft Entra user.

These steps can be completed independently of the [Configure GitHub Enterprise Cloud](#configure-github-enterprise-cloud) steps and can be skipped if you have already verified your domains.

1. Upgrade your organization to the [Corporate Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/upgrading-to-the-corporate-terms-of-service).
1. Verify [your organization's domains](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/verifying-your-organizations-domain).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Make sure to verify each of the managed domains listed in your Defender for Cloud Apps settings. To view your managed domains, go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, and select **Settings**. Then choose **Cloud Apps**. Under **System**, choose **Organizational details**, and then go to the **Managed domains** section.

### Configure GitHub Enterprise Cloud

1. **Find your organization's login name**  
In GitHub, browse to your organization's page, and from the URL, make a note of your organization login name, you'll need it later.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The page will have a URL like `https://github.com/<your-organization>`. For example, if your organization's page is `https://github.com/sample-organization`, the organization's login name is *sample-organization*.

1. **Create an OAuth App for Defender for Cloud Apps to connect your GitHub organization.**  
Repeat this step for each additional connected organization.

    1. Browse to **Settings** > **Developer settings**, select  **OAuth Apps**, and then select **Register an application**. Alternatively, if you have existing OAuth apps, select **New OAuth App**.

        - In the **Authorization callback URL** box, enter the following value: `https://portal.cloudappsecurity.com/api/oauth/saga`.

            > [!NOTE]
            >
            > - For US Government GCC customers, enter the following value: `https://portal.cloudappsecuritygov.com/api/oauth/saga`
            > - For US Government GCC High customers, enter the following value: `https://portal.cloudappsecurity.us/api/oauth/saga`

    > - Apps owned by an organization have access to the organization's apps. For more information, see [About OAuth App access restrictions](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-oauth-app-access-restrictions).

1. Browse to **Settings** > **OAuth Apps**, select the OAuth App you just created, and make note of its **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

   For **Enterprise slug**, also known as the enterprise name, is needed for supporting SSPM capabilities. To find the **Enterprise slug**:
   1. Select the **GitHub Profile picture** -> **your enterprises**.
   1. Select **your enterprise account** and choose the account you want to connect to Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.
   1. Confirm that the URL is the enterprise slug. For instance, in this example `https://github.com/enterprises/testEnterprise` *testEnterprise* is the enterprise slug.

1. Select **Next**.

1. Select **Connect GitHub**.

    The GitHub sign-in page opens. If necessary, enter your GitHub administrator credentials to allow Defender for Cloud Apps access to your team's GitHub Enterprise Cloud instance.

1. Request organization access and authorize the app to give Defender for Cloud Apps access to your GitHub organization.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Defender for Cloud Apps requires the following OAuth scopes:
   >
   > - **admin:org** - required for synchronizing your organization's audit log
   >
   > - **read:user** and **user:email** - required for synchronizing your organization's members
   >
   > - **repo:status** - required for synchronizing repository-related events in the audit log
   >
   > - **admin:enterprise** - required for SSPM capabilities, Note that provided user must be the owner of the enterprise account.
   >
   > For more information about OAuth scopes, see [Understanding scopes for OAuth Apps](https://docs.github.com/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps).

1. Back in the Defender for Cloud Apps console, you should receive a message that GitHub was successfully connected.

1. Work with your GitHub organization owner to grant organization access to the OAuth app created. The organization owner should navigate to **Organization Settings** -> **Integrations** -> **Third-party access** to grant access.

 > [!NOTE]
 >
 > The organization owner will find the request from the OAuth app only after connecting GitHub to Defender for Cloud Apps.

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, select **Settings**. Then choose **Cloud Apps**. Under **Connected apps**, select **App Connectors**. Make sure the status of the connected App Connector is **Connected**.

After connecting GitHub Enterprise Cloud, you'll receive events for 7 days prior to connection.

If you have any problems connecting the app, see [Troubleshooting App Connectors](troubleshooting-api-connectors-using-error-messages.md).
